Designer Notes
--------------

While this game might seem trivial for an adult or a kid with knowledge of functions and rates of growth, these mechanics are not evident at all for young children and even young teens.

The purpose of this game design is: teaching them about different 'categories of growth' and how some growth functions can outrace others.
